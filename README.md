## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

This SQL-based project analyzes churned bank customers using demographic and financial data. The purpose is to identify key trends, behavioral patterns, and risk segments associated with customer churn. Insights derived from this project help inform customer retention strategies and product improvements.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal is to build a comprehensive SQL-driven backend to explore **why customers leave** the bank. Through a series of structured queries, the analysis uncovers churn trends across age, income, card usage, tenure, and demographic factors.

## ðŸ§® SQL Queries and Analysis

### 1. Total Customers, Age, Credit & Utilization
```sql
SELECT 
        COUNT(clientnum), 
        ROUND(AVG(customer_age)), 
        ROUND(AVG(credit_limit), 2), 
        ROUND(AVG(utilization_ratio), 2) 
FROM bank_churn_data;
```

Key Results:

Total Customers: 1,627

Average Age: 47 years

Average Credit Limit: $8,136.04

Average Utilization Ratio: 16.0%

### 2. Average Balance and Credit by Income Group
```sql

SELECT 
    income, 
    AVG(balance) AS avg_balance, 
    AVG(credit_limit) AS avg_credit_limit 
FROM bank_churn_data 
GROUP BY income
ORDER BY avg_balance DESC;
```
**Explanation:**
This query compares average balances and credit access across income levels.

**Insight:**
Customers earning $80Kâ€“$120K have higher balances and access to more credit. However, even lower-income groups hold significant credit limits, suggesting broad access.

### 3. Utilization Distribution Categories
``` SQL 
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN utilization_ratio < 0.2 THEN 'Low (0-20%)'
        WHEN utilization_ratio BETWEEN 0.2 AND 0.5 THEN 'Moderate (20-50%)'
        ELSE 'High (50%+)' 
    END AS utilization_category,
    COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM bank_churn_data
GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN utilization_ratio < 0.2 THEN 'Low (0-20%)'
        WHEN utilization_ratio BETWEEN 0.2 AND 0.5 THEN 'Moderate (20-50%)'
        ELSE 'High (50%+)' 
    END;
```
Explanation:
This bins customers into credit utilization brackets.

Key Insight:

58.5% of churned customers had low credit utilization (0â€“20%), indicating churn may be driven by lack of engagement, not debt pressure.

### 4. Top 10 Customers by Utilization
```SQL 
SELECT 
    clientnum, 
    customer_age, 
    income, 
    credit_limit, 
    ROUND(utilization_ratio, 3) AS utilization_ratio
FROM bank_churn_data
ORDER BY utilization_ratio DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Explanation:
Identifies the highest users of creditâ€”these customers may have left due to credit dependency stress.
